# 100-days-coding-challenge
I am excepting the  100 Days of Code Challenge, it is an initiative where we commit to coding consistently for 100 days. The goal is to enhance our programming skills, build projects, and develop a habit of consistent learning. we choose a programming language (such as TypeScript ) and work on coding projects, solving problems,  Happy coding!
